# 03-machine-learning

## Overview
This module covers supervised, unsupervised, and intro deep learning concepts
with a focus on evaluation discipline and reproducibility. You will build and
assess baseline models, reason about bias/variance, and apply practical
troubleshooting workflows.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Virtual environment tooling (venv)
- Basic numpy familiarity

## How to use this module
- Read the concept pages in order.
- Keep the cheat sheet open while implementing and evaluating models.
- Use the case study as a template for your own projects.
