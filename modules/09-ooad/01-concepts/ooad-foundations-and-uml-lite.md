# OOAD Foundations and UML-Lite

## Overview
OOAD models a system as collaborating objects with responsibilities and clear
boundaries. UML-lite uses minimal class and sequence diagrams to communicate
structure and behavior.

## Why it matters
A shared model reduces rework, clarifies responsibilities, and enables
extendable designs.

## Key ideas
- Objects encapsulate data + behavior
- Responsibilities are explicit and testable
- Diagrams are lightweight and kept close to code

## Practical workflow
- Identify core domain entities and value objects
- Assign responsibilities with CRC-style thinking
- Sketch class diagram for structure and sequence for a use case

## Failure modes
- Over-modeling trivial details
- Diagrams that drift from code
- Treating objects as data bags

## Checklist
- Responsibilities are explicit
- Boundaries are documented
- Diagrams cover critical flows
- Code matches diagrams for key classes
