# Design Patterns: When and Why

## Overview
Patterns are reusable solutions to recurring OO design problems in creation,
behavior, and structure.

## Why it matters
They provide a shared vocabulary and reduce design risk for common pressures.

## Key ideas
- Apply patterns to address specific forces
- Start simple; evolve only when needed
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Practical workflow
- Identify the design pressure (creation, behavior, structure)
- Choose the smallest pattern that fits
- Test the extension points

## Failure modes
- Pattern overuse without need
- Over-generalizing with abstract factories
- Patterns that hide simple logic

## Checklist
- Pattern addresses a real pressure
- Interfaces are minimal
- Extensions require no modification
- Tests demonstrate extensibility
