# Documentation, ADRs, and Design Docs

## Overview
Design docs and ADRs capture intent, tradeoffs, and decisions to make designs
maintainable over time.

## Why it matters
Without documentation, decisions are re-litigated and intent is lost.

## Key ideas
- ADRs record decisions and alternatives
- Design docs capture goals and architecture
- Docs should stay close to code

## Practical workflow
- Write a short design doc for major changes
- Record decisions as ADRs
- Review docs during code review

## Failure modes
- Stale or missing docs
- Overlong documents nobody reads
- Decisions without recorded context

## Checklist
- ADR for each major decision
- Design doc includes goals and non-goals
- Docs updated with code changes
- Consequences are recorded
