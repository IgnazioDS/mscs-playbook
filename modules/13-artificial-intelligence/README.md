# 13-artificial-intelligence

## Status
- Docs: in progress
- Implementations: planned

## Overview
This module covers foundational AI: agents, search, games, constraints,
knowledge representation, uncertainty, and learning. It is written as an
engineering playbook with actionable checklists.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Discrete math, probability, and basic algorithms

## Quickstart
- Read the concepts in order
- Use the cheat sheet for algorithm selection and debugging
- Review case studies for end-to-end modeling patterns
- Future: venv setup, tests, and CLI demos will be added in implementation branches
