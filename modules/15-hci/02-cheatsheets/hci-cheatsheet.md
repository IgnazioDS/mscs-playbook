# HCI Cheat Sheet

## Heuristics checklist
- Visibility of system status
- Match between system and real-world language
- User control and freedom (undo, cancel)
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention and clear recovery paths
- Recognition over recall
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Helpful error messages
- Help and documentation

## Accessibility quick checks
- Color contrast meets basic readability needs
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive controls
- Focus states are visible and predictable
- Form labels are explicit and programmatically associated
- Motion has a reduced-motion alternative
- Text resizes without layout breakage
- Images have meaningful alt text

## Usability test script template
- Intro and consent
- Warm-up questions about context
- Tasks (one at a time, no hints)
- Post-task questions (difficulty, confidence)
- Wrap-up: likes, dislikes, suggestions

## Metrics definitions
- Task success: percent of users completing a task without assistance
- Time-on-task: duration from task start to completion
- SUS: System Usability Scale score (0 to 100)
- Retention: percent of users returning in a time window

## Experiment pitfalls
- Testing too many changes at once
- Stopping early due to noise
- Ignoring guardrail metrics
- Mixing cohorts or overlapping experiments
- Not accounting for novelty effects
