# UI Design Systems and Accessibility

## Overview
Design systems provide reusable components and guidelines to ensure consistency
and accessibility across products.

## Key Concepts
- Component libraries and tokens.
- Accessibility standards and inclusive patterns.
- Consistency across typography, spacing, and states.
- Governance and contribution workflows.

## Practical Notes
- Start with a core set of components used by most flows.
- Document accessible states and keyboard behavior.
- Pair design tokens with implementation tokens.

## Common Pitfalls
- Treating the design system as a static style guide.
- Missing accessibility requirements in components.
- Allowing uncontrolled variants to proliferate.

## Checklist
- Core components have usage and accessibility notes.
- Tokens cover color, spacing, type, and motion.
- Contribution process is defined and enforced.
