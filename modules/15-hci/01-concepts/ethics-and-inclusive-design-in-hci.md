# Ethics and Inclusive Design in HCI

## Overview
Ethical and inclusive HCI practices ensure products respect user rights,
mitigate harm, and work for diverse populations.

## Key Concepts
- Inclusive design and accessibility by default.
- Bias, fairness, and disparate impact in UX.
- Informed consent and data privacy.
- Cultural context and localization.

## Practical Notes
- Involve impacted communities early.
- Document tradeoffs and mitigation plans.
- Avoid dark patterns and manipulative flows.

## Common Pitfalls
- Treating accessibility as a late-stage add-on.
- Assuming one-size-fits-all defaults.
- Using engagement metrics that reward harmful patterns.

## Checklist
- Accessibility requirements are explicit.
- Consent flows are clear and revocable.
- Risk assessment and mitigation documented.
