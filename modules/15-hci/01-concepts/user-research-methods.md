- Evaluative research for validation.
- Qualitative methods: interviews, contextual inquiry.
- Quantitative methods: surveys, logs, experiments.

## Practical Notes

- Recruit for roles and contexts, not demographics alone.
- Triangulate: combine methods to validate findings.

## Common Pitfalls
- Leading questions that bias responses.
- Overgeneralizing from small samples.
- Ignoring organizational constraints in findings.

## Checklist
- Research goals and hypotheses documented.
- Recruiting criteria and screener finalized.
- Protocol piloted and refined.
- Findings linked to decisions and next steps.
