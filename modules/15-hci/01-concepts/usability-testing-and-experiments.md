# Usability Testing and Experiments

## Overview
Usability testing identifies interaction issues, while experiments validate
whether changes improve outcomes.

## Key Concepts
- Moderated vs unmoderated testing.
- Task-based protocols and success criteria.
- A/B and multivariate experiments.
- Power, sample size, and effect size.

## Practical Notes
- Use realistic tasks with clear success definitions.
- Pilot test your script to remove ambiguity.
- Keep changes isolated for clearer causal signals.

## Common Pitfalls
- Optimizing for secondary metrics while core tasks regress.
- Ending experiments early based on noise.
- Confounding variables across variants.

## Checklist
- Tasks and metrics defined up front.
- Session guide and consent process prepared.
- Experiment duration and stopping rule agreed.
