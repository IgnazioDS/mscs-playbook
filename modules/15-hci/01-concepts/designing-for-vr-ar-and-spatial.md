# Designing for VR, AR, and Spatial

## Overview
Spatial interfaces introduce new constraints for attention, comfort, and
interaction that differ from traditional screens.

## Key Concepts
- Spatial anchors and world-locked UI.
- Interaction modalities: gaze, gesture, controllers, voice.
- Comfort and motion sickness mitigation.
- Depth, scale, and occlusion cues.

## Practical Notes
- Keep critical UI within a comfortable field of view.
- Favor short sessions and clear onboarding.
- Test with diverse hardware and physical spaces.

## Common Pitfalls
- Overloading the scene with dense UI.
- Ignoring ergonomics and reach zones.
- Using text sizes that are unreadable at depth.

## Checklist
- Interaction model is consistent across contexts.
- Safety and comfort warnings are clear.
- Accessibility alternatives exist for input.
