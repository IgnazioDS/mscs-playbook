# Interaction Design and Information Architecture

## Overview
Interaction design defines how people complete tasks, while information
architecture structures content so it is findable and understandable.

## Key Concepts
- Task flows and state transitions.
- Navigation models: hierarchy, hub-and-spoke, search-first.
- Labeling and taxonomy design.
- Mental models and affordances.

## Practical Notes
- Map primary tasks before screens.
- Use progressive disclosure to reduce complexity.
- Test navigation with tree tests or first-click tests.

## Common Pitfalls
- Inconsistent labeling across sections.
- Deep hierarchies that hide content.
- Overloading navigation with rarely used links.

## Checklist
- Primary flows documented end-to-end.
- IA map reviewed with stakeholders.
- Labels tested with target users.
- Error and empty states defined.
