# Ideation and Prototyping

## Overview
Ideation and prototyping turn fuzzy problem statements into concrete concepts
that can be evaluated early and cheaply.

## Key Concepts
- Divergent thinking to generate options before narrowing.
- Storyboards and user journeys to anchor ideas in context.
- Fidelity ladder from paper sketches to interactive prototypes.
- Assumption mapping to surface risk and unknowns.

## Practical Notes
- Timebox ideation to avoid analysis paralysis.
- Prototype the riskiest interaction first, not the easiest.
- Keep artifacts lightweight and disposable.
- Capture assumptions alongside sketches.

## Common Pitfalls
- Jumping to high fidelity before testing flows.
- Designing for edge cases without core task clarity.
- Treating prototype feedback as production-ready requirements.

## Checklist
- Problem statement is clear and scoped.
- At least three distinct concepts explored.
- Prototype targets highest risk interaction.
- Feedback plan and success criteria defined.
