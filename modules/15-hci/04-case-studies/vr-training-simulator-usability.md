# VR Training Simulator Usability

## Context
A logistics company is piloting a VR training simulator for warehouse safety
and equipment operation to reduce incident rates.

## Users and Jobs-to-Be-Done
- New hires learning safe forklift operation.
- Supervisors assessing readiness before on-floor training.

## Constraints
- Sessions must be under 20 minutes.
- Motion sickness risk needs active mitigation.
- Hardware is limited to standalone headsets.

## Hypotheses
- Spatial cues and guided prompts will reduce errors.
- Shorter scenarios with rest breaks will lower discomfort.
- A performance dashboard will improve coaching outcomes.

## Prototype Approach
- Low-fidelity VR scene with key interactions only.
- Alternative locomotion methods: teleport versus smooth move.
- Audio guidance variants for safety prompts.

## Evaluation Plan
- Usability tests with 8 trainees across two locations.
- Collect simulator sickness questionnaire after each session.
- Observe error recovery and instructor interventions.

## Metrics
- Task success: correct completion of safety sequence.
- Time-on-task: scenario completion time.
- Error count: collisions, missed checks, unsafe actions.
- Discomfort rate: percent reporting moderate or higher symptoms.

## Results
- Teleport locomotion reduced discomfort by 35 percent.
- Guided prompts improved safety sequence completion by 22 percent.
- Time-on-task increased slightly with more frequent prompts.

## Tradeoffs
- Teleport reduced immersion for experienced operators.
- Extra prompts improved safety but slowed scenario pace.
- Compact scenarios reduced fatigue but limited skill depth.

## Shipping Checklist
- Comfort settings and locomotion options enabled by default.
- Safety prompts verified with subject-matter experts.
- Instructor dashboard includes exportable reports.
- Accessibility options for audio captions and control remapping.
- Fallback training materials for users who cannot use VR.
