# VR Training Simulator Usability

## Context
A manufacturing company pilots a VR simulator to train operators on equipment
setup and safety procedures.

## Users and jobs-to-be-done
- New hires learning setup steps
- Trainers validating competency
- Safety officers auditing compliance

## Constraints
- Motion sickness risk and hardware variability
- Training sessions limited to 15 minutes
- Offline operation in factory environment

## Hypotheses
- Guided spatial cues reduce task errors.
- Shorter modules improve retention and comfort.

## Prototype approach
- Low-fidelity scenes to test navigation and input
- High-fidelity prototype with step-by-step cues
- Alternative input modes for accessibility

## Evaluation plan
- In-lab usability sessions with trainers and new hires
- Compare task completion vs classroom training

## Metrics
- Task completion rate
- Error rate per step
- Time on task
- Self-reported comfort and nausea scores

## Results
- Task completion improved by 15 percent
- Error rate reduced by 22 percent
- Comfort scores acceptable after shorter sessions

## Tradeoffs
- Reduced realism to maintain performance
- Extra onboarding for controller use

## Shipping checklist
- Comfort and safety guidance included
- Input alternatives documented
- Performance targets met on baseline hardware
- Data capture and privacy policy approved
