# 10-nlp

## Status
- Docs: complete
- Implementations: planned

## Overview
This module covers practical NLP foundations: preprocessing, representation,
classic models, transformers, evaluation, and production tradeoffs. It is
written as an engineering playbook with actionable checklists.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Basic linear algebra and probability

## Quickstart
- Read the concepts in order
- Use the cheat sheet for model selection and debugging
- Future: venv + tests + CLI will be added in implementation branches
