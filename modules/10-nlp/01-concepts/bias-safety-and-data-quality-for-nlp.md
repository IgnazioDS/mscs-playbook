# Bias, Safety, and Data Quality for NLP

## Overview
NLP systems can amplify bias and misinformation if data quality and safety
controls are weak.

## Why it matters
Production NLP affects users directly; failures can cause harm or legal risk.

## Key ideas
- Bias in training data
- PII and sensitive content handling
- Safety filters and content policies

## Practical workflow
- Audit datasets for bias and leakage
- Define safety rules and redaction
- Monitor outputs and feedback loops

## Failure modes
- Biased outcomes from skewed data
- Leaking sensitive information
- Prompt injection or misuse

## Checklist
- Data audits and documentation
- Safety tests and redaction rules
- Monitoring for harmful outputs
