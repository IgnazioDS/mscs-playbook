# 12-computer-vision

## Status
- Docs: in progress
- Implementations: planned

## Overview
This module covers practical computer vision: image representations, classical
features, CNNs and transformers, detection/segmentation, evaluation, and
production tradeoffs. It is written as an engineering playbook with actionable
checklists.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Basic linear algebra and probability
- Familiarity with training ML models

## Quickstart
- Read the concepts in order
- Use the cheat sheet for preprocessing, debugging, and deployment notes
- Review case studies for end-to-end patterns
- Future: venv setup, tests, and CLI demos will be added in implementation branches
