# 14-reinforcement-learning

## Status
- Docs: in progress
- Implementations: planned

## Overview
This module covers reinforcement learning fundamentals: MDPs, dynamic
programming, Monte Carlo and TD methods, function approximation, policy
gradients, exploration, and safety. It is written as an engineering playbook
with actionable checklists.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Probability, linear algebra, and optimization basics

## Quickstart
- Read the concepts in order
- Use the cheat sheet for algorithm selection and debugging
- Review case studies for end-to-end patterns
- Future: venv setup, tests, and CLI demos will be added in implementation branches
