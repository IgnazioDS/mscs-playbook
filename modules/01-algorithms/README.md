# 01-algorithms

## Status
- Concepts, cheat sheet, case study, and mini-project are complete.
- Python reference implementations and tests are complete and runnable.

## Overview
This module builds practical algorithm intuition and implementation skills.
It emphasizes dynamic programming, greedy reasoning, graph toolkits, and core
data structures, with lightweight coverage of approximation, RSA, and quantum
ideas. The goal is correct, testable code and clear selection tradeoffs.

## How to use this module
- Read concepts in order, then scan the cheat sheet.
- Study implementations in `03-implementations/python/src/`.
- Run tests to validate understanding and changes.
