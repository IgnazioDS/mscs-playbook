# Ethical Frameworks for Engineers

## What it is
A set of decision lenses (duty, outcomes, rights, justice) to evaluate tradeoffs.

## Why it matters
Frameworks help teams justify decisions consistently under uncertainty.

## Core concepts
- Deontological: duty-based obligations and constraints
- Consequentialist: outcomes and harm minimization
- Rights-based: protect autonomy and consent
- Justice/fairness: equitable distribution of benefits/harms

## Common failure modes
- Optimizing for one lens while ignoring others
- Using frameworks as post-hoc justification
- Ignoring affected stakeholders who lack power

## Engineering checklist
- Identify stakeholders and impacted groups
- State the primary lens and why
- Record alternatives and tradeoffs
- Document residual risk and mitigation plan
