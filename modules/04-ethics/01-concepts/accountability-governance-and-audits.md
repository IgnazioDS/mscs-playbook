# Accountability, Governance, and Audits

## What it is

Organizational controls for decision ownership, oversight, and evidence.

## Why it matters

Accountability reduces systemic risk and enables remediation.

## Core concepts

- Clear decision ownership and escalation paths
- Audit trails for data and model changes
- Independent review for high-risk systems

## Common failure modes

- No single accountable owner
- Incomplete audit logs or undocumented changes
- Risk decisions made without cross-functional input

## Engineering checklist

- Assign a responsible owner for risk sign-off
- Maintain change logs for datasets and models
- Schedule periodic audits and post-launch reviews
