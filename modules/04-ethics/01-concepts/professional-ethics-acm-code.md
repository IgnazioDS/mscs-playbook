# Professional Ethics and ACM Code

## What it is
Professional codes define responsibilities to the public, clients, and employers.

## Why it matters
Codes provide minimum standards and accountability for safety and integrity.

## Core concepts
- Prioritize public good and safety
- Avoid harm, be honest about limitations
- Respect privacy and confidentiality
- Maintain competence and disclose conflicts

## Common failure modes
- Treating code as optional or symbolic
- Hiding known risks to meet deadlines
- Failing to document limitations and caveats

## Engineering checklist
- Map product risks to code principles
- Document known limitations in release notes
- Escalate when risks conflict with deadlines
