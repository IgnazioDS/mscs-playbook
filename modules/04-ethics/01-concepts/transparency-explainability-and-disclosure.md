# Transparency, Explainability, and Disclosure

## What it is

Making system behavior and limitations understandable to users and stakeholders.

## Why it matters

Transparency builds trust and enables informed consent and oversight.

## Core concepts

- Model cards and data cards
- Explainability vs interpretability
- Disclosure of known limitations and failure modes

## Common failure modes

- Overpromising model capabilities
- Hiding uncertainty or edge-case failures
- Black-box decisions without recourse

## Engineering checklist

- Provide plain-language explanations
- Document performance by segment
- Offer user recourse or appeal paths
